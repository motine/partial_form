- use the current layout name to find the path for the partials (and fall back to form)
  - /app/views/layouts/layoutname/form (add test for this)
  - /app/views/layouts/form
- [ ] tests
  - renders partial from gem
  - partial from app takes precedence
  - passes options
  - passes on blocks
  - generator works
  - https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Generators/Testing/Behavior.html#method-i-prepare_destination
- [ ] test if i can also use a lower version of rails (change actionview)
- adapt gemspec meta data
- performance benchmarks
- marketing
  - ask in the thread how to get the word out
  - blog post (talk to smartygus; the tailwind recommendation is to use partials)
  - see https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/introduce-a-standard-formbuilder-that-leverages-partials/86790

Magic alternative:
    # METHOD_MATCHER = /^_(.*)/

    # def method_missing(name, *, **)
    #   if name =~ METHOD_MATCHER
    #     return render_partial($1, *, **)
    #   end

    #   super
    # end

    # def respond_to_missing?(method, include_all)
    #   METHOD_MATCHER.match?(method) || super
    # end
